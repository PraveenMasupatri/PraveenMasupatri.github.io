Cybersecurity graduate student with a strong passion for threat detection, cloud security, incident response, and security operations. Hands-on experience with SIEM platforms like Splunk and Microsoft Sentinel, conducting security investigations, analyzing attack patterns, and optimizing detection capabilities.

Previously at Accenture, worked on strengthening security monitoring, log analysis, and incident response workflows, collaborating with teams to refine security protocols and risk assessments. Additionally, experience as a Support Analyst and Consultant, utilizing Azure Databricks, SQL, Power BI, and ServiceNow to analyze security data and improve operational efficiency.

With a strong focus on cloud security, web application security, and security analytics, I am dedicated to exploring innovative solutions that strengthen cybersecurity resilience. Actively seeking opportunities to apply my technical expertise in real-world security challenges, I aim to contribute to cutting-edge cybersecurity initiatives.
